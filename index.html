    <p>I think cars are interesting machines, they have so many different features and quirks for each one.</p>
    <p>Each car has a unique engine for the most part and produce different amount of <strong>power</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Engines</h2>
    <p>The engine above is from a <strong>Mercedes-AMG G65 Final Edition</strong> it is quite powerful, producing 621 hp.</p>
    <p>Engines are quite confusing pieces of machinery, many have thousands of parts involved in them
      and they all have to <p>work cohesively at the same time.
    </p>
    <h3>Brands and Bodies</h3>
    <p>Many of you may have heard of different types of car brands, Toyota, Honda, Ford, or Chevy just to name a few.</p>
    <p>There are also more exotic brands and that list is just as large, but each one has a uniqure way of showing off the car.</p>
    <p>Some show it through power, some through looks, other through <strong>power and looks</strong> but they all do the same thing, drive.</p>
